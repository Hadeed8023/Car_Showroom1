                        But it wasn't always that way. Back in 2002, online reviews were not yet a part of the fabric of consumer decision-making and their influence was still unproven. Yelp! was only an expression a cartoon character made when it stubbed its toe. And Google was still focusing on just being a good search engine.
                        When a particularly polarizing car-buying experience at a local dealership led our founder, Chip Grueter, a car enthusiast and web developer by trade, to search for an online outlet to broadcast his story, he came up empty. So, he decided to build one himself — and DealerRater was born.
                        Today, about 7,000,000 consumer reviews later, DealerRater is the global standard for car dealership reviews and research — and more than 34 million consumers are exposed to our reviewers' content every month.
                        We've connected millions of consumers with the right car dealership for them, and hopefully made the process a little less scary and more transparent along the way.
